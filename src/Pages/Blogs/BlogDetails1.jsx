                      In recent times, opinions and reviews have become crucial
                      for most businesses of all sizes. Consumers read reviews
                      to decide if that particular business or store is worth
                      their time and money. Most of us rely on the reviews;
                      hence, they are pivotal for your business and to respond
                      and reply to them is very crucial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Google reviews are necessary for any local business, as
                      73% of users search for online reviews, and consumers are
                      twice as likely to search for new local businesses on
                      Google.

                      Replying to customers or customer feedback can be tricky,
                      but it doesn’t have to be. This blog is to help you avoid
                      common mistakes that could fuel negative word-of-mouth and
                      make it difficult to attract new customers. Let us see how
                      creatively you can reply to google reviews and facebook
                      feedback.

                      <h2>Why Are Reviews Important?</h2>
                      <p>
                        It is a legitimate question because the most formidable
                        weapon against errors of every kind is reason! Reviews
                        for any business are crucial for three main reasons, and
                        let’s look at each one of them now.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The first is to get new customers. Every business needs
                        new customers for growth and revenue.{" "}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Imagine a scenario where a customer is looking for a
                        cake shop to buy a cake, and he comes across two shops.
                      </p>
                      <p>Shop A has ten reviews with a 4.3 rating out of 5</p>
                      <p>Shop B has six reviews with a 3.1 rating out of 5</p>
                      <p>
                        The person will probably choose Shop A as it has better
                        Google reviews. He is among those 57% of consumers who
                        only opt for businesses with a higher rating (4 or
                        above).{" "}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you have been avoiding reviews, this example should
                        help you do otherwise.{" "}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Note that if your shop or business has fewer reviews,
                        new customers might not even find your business in the
                        first place. And you certainly DO NOT want that!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        According to Local SEO Guide, “The prominence of review
                        isn’t particularly shocking, as it’s a way for Google to
                        crowdsource ranking factors, it’s hard to spam, and the
                        most problematic type of abuse is illegal.”
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        The second reason is that reviews boost your business’s
                        local SEO. You might already know Google’s proximity
                        factor for filtering local search results. Good reviews
                        are the factors that impact Google’s search results.{" "}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Here’s an easy example for you to understand. Imagine
                        you are in a new city looking for the best store to buy
                        a new dress. When you search in Google for the same, you
                        will have options closest to you. But if a shop has
                        better ratings than the one closest to you, Google will
                        recommend that shop.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Managing your online reputation and brand visibility
                        will help you reach potential customers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you are wondering why Google produces such results,
                        the main reason is to provide the best results against
                        your searches and reviews.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        The third reason is that reviews are an opportunity to
                        get better! Organizations usually conduct customer
                        satisfaction surveys to know how customers feel about
                        their products and services! Reviews are the same. You
                        get positive, neutral, and negative comments.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So engage with the reviews and take full advantage of
                        the opportunity.
                      </p>

                    <div>
                      <h2>Why do we need to reply to Google reviews?</h2>
                      <p>
                        Google ranks those businesses that are reliable and
                        trustworthy. As Google wants to provide the best result
                        to a search query, it looks for quality also.{" "}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When we respond to Google reviews, we help Google see us
                        as a trustworthy place of business, boosting our
                        credibility online and offline.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It also greatly affects local SEO. So, if you have
                        Google reviews, then make sure you reply to them.

                      <h2>How to Respond to Positive Google Reviews?</h2>
                      <p>
                        Positive reviews make you happy and keep you motivated.
                        Customers love your business, and they tell their
                        friends about it. So, you must acknowledge your
                        delighted customers by replying to their positive
                        feedback. The following ways will help you create that
                        bond between your ‘happy’ customer and you.
                      </p>
                      <h3>1. Personalise the review:</h3>
                      <p>
                        When replying, personalise it using the person’s name,
                        mention the product, and emphasise thanking them.
                      </p>
                      <h3>2. Timely response:</h3>
                      <p>
                        Respond quickly to the feedback if possible. The
                        customer has gone out of their way to leave a review.
                        Your responses promptly create a good impression and
                        sense of acknowledgement for the customer.
                      </p>
                      <h3>3. State your happiness:</h3>
                      <p>
                        Construct your reply to show you are happy to help/serve
                        them and appreciate them taking their time to share a
                        review.
                      </p>
                      <h3>4. Match reviewers’ energy:</h3>
                      <p>
                        Try to respond in the same energy band as a customer.
                        For example, if the customer has responded with
                        enthusiasm, be sure to respond to him with great energy.

                          name, then ensure to mention that name in your
                          response.{" "}

                        <li>
                          Add local business keywords to your response. These
                          keywords could be your business name, location,
                          products, and services.

                        <li>

                          to your response.

                        <li>
                          It would be best to mention other products and

                        for you. Also, remember to reply to the fake review. An

                        Hi, (Fake Customer Name),
                        <br />
                        We take these matters very seriously. Unfortunately, we
                        have no record or recollection of your experience with
                        us, nor can we verify anything about your identity from
                        your name in our records.
                        <br />
                        We want to investigate further if you have done business
                        with us. Please contact (Manager’s Name) immediately at
                        (Email/Phone Number) so we can resolve this issue.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Why do we need to reply to Facebook Feedback?</h2>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        While running a business on Facebook, you might consider
                        taking your reviews seriously, as they greatly impact
                        your presence on the platform.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Facebook reviews appear in your business page’s ‘Reviews
                        or Recommendations section’. Compared to Google,
                        Facebook can turn off the reviews, but it is recommended
                        not to do it as reviews impact your potential customers,
                        and it is one of the ways to establish your brand’s
                        voice.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When you are running a Facebook business page, reviews
                        are one of the ways of introducing and educating people
                        on Facebook about your business. Managing the Facebook
                        business page and working continuously to improve your
                        overall public image is important.

                          Acknowledge the review and thank the customer for

                      <h3>How do I respond to a Google business review?</h3>
                      <p>It is important to remember that it is about the customer’s feelings and not about you. Irrespective of the type of review (positive/negative/neutral), be polite and reply promptly. If there has been an issue and you can resolve it offline, take the initiative and do so.</p>

                      <p>Reply to the reviewer from your Facebook business profile. Use words from the review in your reply so that the customer knows that you have read the review. The response should be clear and make the customer understand that you have understood them or heard them.</p>
