                        Why is opening a cloud kitchen a good idea?
                      </strong>
                      <br />
                      Here’s what happens exactly in a cloud kitchen model:
                      Orders come in, meals are cooked, packed, and then whisked
                      immediately to their delivery locations by the assigned
                      fleet.
                      <br />
                      Why does this work?{" "}
                      <b>
                        Because you’re cutting costs on front-of-house
                        activities and concentrating on your food.
                      </b>{" "}
                      With the availability of third-party services and the
                      growing comfort of mobile ordering, this model seems just
                      right to experiment with. There are more benefits involved
                      like:
                    </p>

                    <div>
                      <h2>Lower real estate costs</h2>
                      <p>
                        Since you’re removing table servicing out of the
                        equation and offering a delivery-only service, you’ll
                        save a huge amount on real estate costs.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Cloud kitchens release you from the obligation of having
                        space in a high-visibility area. Rather than paying for
                        accessibility, better-developed complexes, or even a
                        large parking space, you can concentrate on having
                        enough kitchen space in a decent area near your target
                        market.

                      <h2>Better expansion opportunities</h2>
                      <p>
                        The best thing about cloud kitchens is that you don’t
                        need heavy investments to begin. You can start small but
                        expand fast. Once you build a brand and get loyal
                        customers, expanding to new localities and even new menu
                        varieties gets easier. Let’s take the example of Faasos,
                        today it runs 160+ kitchens and 4 brands including
                        Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, and Firangi Bake.

                      <h3>Saving on overhead costs</h3>
                      <p>
                        With a cloud kitchen, you save so much on overhead
                        costs. You don’t need client-facing staff, decoration or
                        space entrance, parking area, etc. Even if you have
                        lower-priced menu items, your profit margins are likely
                        to be better.
                      </p>

                    <div>
                      <h3>How does a cloud kitchen work?</h3>
                      <p>
                        Cloud kitchens are centralized licensed commercial food
                        production facilities where anywhere from one or two to
                        dozens of restaurants rent space to prepare
                        delivery-optimized menu items. One restaurant may run
                        multiple brands or virtual restaurants, all operating
                        under one roof, or the kitchen may be run like an
                        incubator, shared by different purveyors. Picture a
                        large warehouse with numerous stations
                        (mini-restaurants) of stainless steel prep tables, hood
                        vents, stoves, ovens, and sinks, each with its own
                        orders coming in directly from customers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Cloud kitchen menu items are optimized for ease of
                        production and reliability of food quality upon
                        delivery. Often physically located in out-of-town
                        industrial complexes, cloud kitchens may offer driver
                        parking, driver waiting areas (often with screens to
                        monitor order times), and check-in stations for seamless
                        driver pick-up. All are designed to get food out the
                        door and into the customer’s hands as fast as possible.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Cloud kitchens are uniquely tech-enabled. They take
                        advantage of the now ubiquitous food delivery apps on
                        your smartphone, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub, and
                        Doordash.
                        <br /> In doing so, they use large amounts of data to
                        determine what types of foods to produce for specific
                        neighborhoods and when the demand is likely to be
                        greatest. For example, hot wings tend to be really
                        popular between 11 pm-2 am near college campuses. This
                        data is fueling rapid adaptation and optimization,
                        almost in real time.
                        <br /> As the technology has matured, additional
                        services have emerged to aggregate the various delivery
                        apps into one portal, for easier production of multiple
                        orders and delivery coordination as well as smart food
                        purchasing and production software for decreased food
                        waste and increased per-meal unit economics. We have
                        only seen the tip of the iceberg of innovation in this
                        space.

                      <h2>Competing in a crowded digital marketplace</h2>
                      <p>
                        With no physical location, cloud kitchens don’t benefit
                        from walk-in traffic. You are competing exclusively in a
                        crowded online marketplace. The good news is, if your
                        product is good enough, it should rise to the top thanks
                        to social proof like good reviews and word-of-mouth
                        referrals. But you may find yourself having to pay for
                        visibility on these platforms. That is, after all, how
                        they make their money. You should be aware of this
                        potential added cost, especially at the beginning,
                        before you’re able to develop your own loyal following.
                      </p>

                    <div>
                      <h2>Food quality and food safety</h2>
                      <p>
                        With a delivery-only brand, your reputation relies on
                        the food getting to the customer in perfect condition.
                        Getting this right is the only way to get repeat orders.
                        There are significant challenges in keeping the product
                        at proper temperatures so it arrives as intended to the
                        customer. Not just at the right temperature for them to
                        best enjoy it but also to ensure it is safe to eat.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This means testing out different types of packaging and
                        potentially investing in containers that are more
                        expensive and harder to source. This is a cost that can
                        quickly add up when you are pumping out a high volume of
                        orders, but it is a vital consideration. Soggy, lukewarm
                        food will guarantee failure. And one food-borne illness
                        or outbreak and your brand is toast.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      <h2>Local regulation and licensure</h2>
                      <p>
                        Food production is largely regulated at the local level
                        by your health department. Since cloud kitchens are so
                        new, regulators may be unfamiliar with the concept. They
                        may start hitting you with unexpected requirements, or
                        start treating you like a full-service restaurant.
                        <br />
                        Agents will want to see that food is being safely
                        stored, produced, packaged, and delivered, which may
                        require the production of <b>HACCP</b> and other
                        production plans for review. Also, having multiple
                        tenants producing under one roof increases the
                        complexity of who is licensed to produce and distribute
                        food. You must be prepared to go the extra mile in
                        showing them that your operation is safe and
                        responsible.

                      <h2>What’s behind the cloud kitchen trend?</h2>
                      <p>
                        Cloud kitchens started popping up in the early 2010s in
                        response to increased demand for high-quality meal
                        delivery and rising rents in city center locations.
                        Green Summit Group opened one of the first cloud
                        kitchens in New York City in 2013, and has grown out to
                        four locations across two cities.
                        <br /> Many more start-ups have followed suit and as we
                        enter a new decade, cloud kitchens are becoming big
                        business, with venture capital pouring into start-ups
                        specifically aiming to take advantage of this new
                        market.
                        <br /> The trend is driven by the coming of age of
                        millennials with disposable income demanding digital,
                        mobile-friendly solutions. And this will only get more
                        pronounced as the next generation, who have grown up
                        with the internet and smartphones, enters the
                        marketplace (sorry boomers). Looking further forward
                        advances in kitchen automation, drone delivery, and the
                        continued growth of the gig economy look to give cloud
                        kitchens more of an advantage by lowering their costs
                        even further.
                      </p>
                      <br />

                        <li>
                          Let’s take a closer look at the factors affecting the
                          trend.
                        </li>
                        <li>Real estate prices in urban areas</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                        As urban real estate prices continue their upward trend,
                        delivery-only kitchens are able to take advantage of
                        their ‘virtual’ nature. The only restriction on their
                        location is that they must be within a realistic
                        delivery distance of enough hungry customers.
                        <br /> Companies like Kitchen United are focussing on
                        light industrial areas outside dense urban centers but
                        near enough to satisfy the demand of residential areas.
                        Large warehouses at low rents are the perfect venues to

                        Food delivery is set to grow to a $200 billion industry
                        by 2025, due to shifting changes in behavior, with
                        nearly half of consumers preferring to eat at home. Uber
                        is even more optimistic than most, valuing the market at
                        $795 billion.
                        <br /> With 91 million monthly users, Uber Eats is
                        currently the most popular food delivery app. Consumers
                        are increasingly willing to pay a significant amount for
                        the convenience of having their food delivered.

                        increase in on-demand contract workers. The number of
                        people working as ride-share drivers, delivery drivers,
                        and remote workers is on the rise, offering low-cost
                        labor with no strings attached from an employer’s point
                        of view. However the stability of the gig economy is
                        still unknown. California recently passed a law that
                        requires that some companies treat contract workers as
                        employees.

                        Looking further forward, drone delivery and kitchen
                        automation are set to disrupt the standard restaurant

                        regulations standing in its way.
                        <br /> Tech-minded shared kitchens are perfectly
                        positioned to take advantage of these advances. They are
                        much more able and likely to adapt quickly to new

                      <p>
                        Because they are designed with tech in mind, cloud
                        kitchens can optimize processes, ordering, and staff
                        scheduling based on consumer behavior. The menu can also
                        be adapted to suit demand and increase margins,
                        optimizing the model over time.
                        <br /> Not being tied to a physical location means you
                        can change the menu or operating times to suit business
                        needs without as much of an impact on customer
                        satisfaction. This can also help to decrease food waste,
                        as you can be smarter with ordering and prep decisions.
                        <br /> In fact, virtual restaurants are so adaptable,
                        you can even launch a brand just for a season. For
                        instance, you could launch a healthy salad brand for the
                        summer and a hearty poutine concept for the winter
                        months, allowing you to take advantage of the seasonal
                        demand for each type of food without enduring any
                        downturn.

                        cheaper overall, especially if you are creative about

                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        With any new technology, there are going to be certain
                        drawbacks along with the benefits. Here are some of the
                        potential challenges that come with running a cloud
                        kitchen.
                        <br /> Working with on-demand staff running a cloud
                        kitchen, you may be more inclined to hire on-demand
                        staff to control margins. While this can save on your
                        wage bill, it comes with some caveats. Since staff won’t
                        be interacting with guests or getting tips, it could
                        feel more like working in a factory than a hospitality
                        job. Of course, you can try to boost morale and motivate
                        staff in other ways, but it may be more difficult to
                        build a brand culture if you are not attracting the top
                        food service talent.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Hiring on-demand staff also carries risks in terms of
                        food safety and consistency, both vital to successful
                        food businesses. Can you be sure these workers have
                        adequate training? If you want to invest in training, it
                        makes more sense to hire permanent staff members. There
                        is a trade-off here that you will have to work on to try
                        to figure out the best balance between on-demand workers
                        and permanent staff.

                        For all the benefits of using delivery apps, it’s never
                        a good business decision to rely on one source of
                        customers. The high fees can also eat into your margins
                        and you have little control over last-mile delivery
                        which can affect the quality of the food and put your
                        reputation at risk. One way to counter this is to offer
                        your own delivery service, but this comes with higher
                        marketing costs and logistical complications.

                        The primary reason behind the low investment needed to
                        open a cloud kitchen is the real estate cost. Location
                        is the biggest differentiator that reduces the cost of
                        opening a cloud kitchen as compared to a traditional
                        dine-in restaurant.

                          high-end sites. However, it does have a lot to do with
                          proper sanitation and water supply with low rentals.

                        you are selling. The cloud kitchen should be located

                        revenue per order. There is also a one-time integration
                        fee involved for some FoodTech companies.

                        time-consuming task. Apart from this rest of the permits

                        It is important to choose the right vendors at this
                        stage for the raw materials.

                        You should allocate an extra budget for packaging as it
                        plays a crucial role in creating a brand recall for the
                        customers. The packaging must be sturdy to preserve the
                        quality of the food during the delivery.

                      <p>
                        Since you are no longer able to provide a physical guest
                        experience, packaging should leave a good impression on
                        the minds of the customers. Ensure that the packaging
                        contains your restaurant’s logo and reflects the theme
                        and concept of your restaurant.

                      <p>
                        The secret sauce behind a successful restaurant is the
                        team that works for it, with the Chef being the most
                        critical part of the team, as they not only prepare the
                        food but also help in designing the menu.
                        <b>
                          In an online kitchen, a minimum of five employees is
                          required.
                        </b>{" "}
                        You’d need at least two chefs, two helpers, and one
                        housekeeper. The salary of the staff depends on their
                        experience.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The average salary of the Chef at Commis level 1 is Rs
                        14000- Rs 15000, while that of helpers and other staff
                        salary ranges between Rs 6000- Rs 8000 based on their
                        work. Apart from the kitchen staff, two employees at the
                        delivery and one at the counter for receiving online and
                        telephonic orders are required. Here we would also like
                        to recommend you to partner with the third-party

                        For a cloud kitchen, one may feel that a staff uniform
                        is not required. However, it is still heavily
                        recommended to have a dress code for maintaining
                        discipline, cleanliness, and hygiene.
                        <b>
                          Also, provide your cloud kitchen staff with essential

                        becomes the single source of getting orders. Since you
                        are not spending on location and other maintenance
