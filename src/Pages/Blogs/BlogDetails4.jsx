                      A website is a must if you own a restaurant and want to
                      create a digital identity for your business. A website is
                      important to interact with customers and attract potential
                      customers through the website. Therefore, the website for
                      any restaurant needs to be interactive. However, there are
                      so many different website platforms that it becomes
                      difficult to choose a feature-rich platform that provides
                      you with all the features. One of the two most popular
                      platforms for a restaurant website is HTML and WordPress,
                      and people are usually confused between the two. Both
                      types of websites have their advantage, but which is best
                      for a restaurant? Let’s find out.

                      <h2>Restaurant website based on HTML</h2>
                      <p>
                        HTML is one of the most basic ways to create a website,
                        but it can be customized to your favorite design through
                        CSS. A restaurant website based on HTML will come with
                        the most simple-to-use user interface, where you can
                        easily provide textual, video, and image forms of
                        information to the viewers. If you want your customers
                        to open the website and other pages on it with speed,
                        then HTML is the best option. You can provide the
                        details of your restaurant, images of the recipes, pages
                        to introduce your team, and more.

                        <li>
                          Can easily integrate images, video, and text to show
                          and describe various recipes and dishes

                        <li>
                          Requires fewer server resources, so your website will
                          open faster and will be up almost every time.

                          Takes less time to develop, and the cost of creating
                          an HTML website for a restaurant would less.

                        almost anything, limited only by the imagination of the
