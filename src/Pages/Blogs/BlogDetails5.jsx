                      <p>
                        A one-page document highlighting the creative assets of
                        a brand, like a logo, design, colour, typography, and
                        brand philosophy to make customers aware and educated
                        about the brand and at the same time, a branding guide
                        for hotels strikes an emotional connection with them. It
                        serves as a manual of guidelines a hotel brand is based
                        on to ensure that it creates a brand perception of the
                        business, in this case, a hotel in the eyes of the
                        customers.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      <h2>
                        Why do you need a brand guide for hotels and
                        restaurants?
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Each business is different, but each requires a brand
                        identity and image so that people can identify it across
                        all channels, both physically and digitally. When we
                        speak of the hotel industry, a brand guide plays a
                        quintessential role in making your hotel different and
                        appealing to tourists, visitors, and potential customers
                        than others. If you don’t follow certain brand
                        guidelines you will never be able to make a lasting
                        impression in the market, nobody will recognize you, and
                        nobody will remember it.

                    <div>
                      <h2>
                        Let us understand the components of a brand guide with
                        examples:
                      </h2>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      <h2>Brand voice</h2>
                      <p>
                        Brand voice is the message that the brand wants to
                        deliver and establish in the market, especially in the
                        eyes of the customers. A good example of a changing
                        brand voice came from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company in
                        2015 when they revealed a new logo and brand voice and
                        promoted it across all channels to meet their guests.
                        They made this change after 32 years.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      <h2>Typography</h2>
                      <p>
                        Take the example of any brand that you come across, you
                        will find that there is a certain font, a type of
                        structure they are following that not only makes them
                        stand out from others but, at the same time, it offers
                        them a new identity so much so that people instantly
                        relate to a certain brand. You won’t believe it, but
                        that’s how much the typography of a brand has ingrained
                        into our minds.
                        <br /> For example, to understand the logo and
                        typography, let’s consider Park Hyatt, a sub-brand of
                        the Hyatt Hotel Group. The typography is sleek and at
                        the same time, it restores elegance in it. They use the
                        serif font and the use of lines replicates strength.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      <h2>Colour palette</h2>
                      <p>
                        When I say red you can immediately think of Zomato, when
                        I say Swiggy you have an orange colour logo forming in
                        your head, but it’s not even a typical orange but
                        somewhere between red and yellow. Have you ever come
                        across a brand that has multiple colour usage in its
                        design, symbols, and logos? Go on, take a minute, think
                        about it –<br /> You may not be able to think of any
                        brand after I gave you the example of single-color
                        brands, but actually, there are many, do you know what
                        separates them? They are following a colour palette.
                        <br /> Let alone if we Take the example of hotels, let’s
                        talk about the Plaza Hotel in New York City, It has been
                        a prominent location for many film shoots, The Plaza
                        uses pink and its shades to add a touch of sweetness,
                        and the hotel is known to use every shade of pink to
                        replicate a feeling and spark a vibe for their guests.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      <h2>Imagery</h2>
                      <p>
                        Pay attention, here we are not talking about a single
                        picture that speaks for the brand, but all the visuals
                        that come together to create brand imagery in a variety
                        of ways. Now, these images can be used in multiple
                        channels, from billboards to Instagram, in print ads on
                        websites as well.
                        <br /> When you are a hotel brand, such pictures can
                        trigger your customers or a tourist to remember you and
                        make a mental note of it, so the next time they are
                        booking a hotel they will remember you. Remember, these
                        are not random pictures but convey an emotion, most
                        importantly the brand values. Many hotels use
                        single-colour imagery because it retains sophistication
                        and directly speaks to the eyes of potential customers.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      <h2>Tonality</h2>
                      <p>
                        Every hotel has a distinctive personality, for example,
                        if you have to describe your hotel to a stranger for the
                        first time, how will you do it? It is often suggested in
                        hotel branding, that the owners must avoid using jargon
                        and buzzwords.
                        <br /> Your hotel’s persona should bring a specific
                        image to mind. Having clarity can help you create good
                        marketing creatives and copies, but not only that, it
                        resembles one of the main brand guidelines.
                        <br /> A subtle example of this would be the Aman –
                        Luxury hotel, The hotel brand maximize the use of
                        graphic images and only uses simple snippets but
                        on-point information text, and again it is beautiful in
                        its own way. The design sets the tone of the entire
                        hotel chain.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      <h2>Brand Philosophy</h2>
                      <p>
                        Like every individual has their way of doing things,
                        this same formula applies to hotels and most importantly
                        brands. So why certain brands do something and why they
                        do it in a certain way replicates the brand philosophy,
                        and that’s a pivotal part of the brand guide. People
                        visiting your hotel must believe in its philosophy of
                        doing things and how it caters to its customers.
                        <br /> Another good example comes from the Ritz-Carlton
                        hotels making an art form of guest service. They stated
                        that a great service philosophy always empowers
                        employees to demonstrate a higher degree of trust and
                        work toward guest satisfaction.
                        <br /> At last, we can easily conclude that a brand
                        guide is a significant tool in marketing. If you are a
                        hotel owner and also struggling to set brand guidelines
