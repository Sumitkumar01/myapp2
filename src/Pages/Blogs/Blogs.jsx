    link: "respond-to-facebook-google-reviews",
    data: `
<div>
  <p>
    In recent times, opinions and reviews have become crucial
    for most businesses of all sizes. Consumers read reviews
    to decide if that particular business or store is worth
    their time and money. Most of us rely on the reviews;
    hence, they are pivotal for your business and to respond
    and reply to them is very crucial.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Google reviews are necessary for any local business,</b> as
    73% of users search for online reviews, and consumers are
    twice as likely to search for new local businesses on
    Google.
  </p>
  <p>
    Replying to customers or customer feedback can be tricky,
    but it doesn’t have to be. This blog is to help you avoid
    common mistakes that could fuel negative word-of-mouth and
    make it difficult to attract new customers. Let us see how
    creatively you can reply to google reviews and facebook
    feedback.
  </p>

  <div>
    <h2>Why Are Reviews Important?</h2>
    <p>
      It is a legitimate question because the most formidable
      weapon against errors of every kind is reason! Reviews
      for any business are crucial for three main reasons, and
      let’s look at each one of them now.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>first</b> is to get new customers. Every business needs
      new customers for growth and revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine a scenario where a customer is looking for a
      cake shop to buy a cake, and he comes across two shops.
    </p>
    <p>Shop A has ten reviews with a 4.3 rating out of 5</p>
    <p>Shop B has six reviews with a 3.1 rating out of 5</p>
    <p>
      The person will probably choose Shop A as it has better
      Google reviews. He is among those 57% of consumers who
      only opt for businesses with a higher rating (4 or
      above).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have been avoiding reviews, this example should
      help you do otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that if your shop or business has fewer reviews,
      new customers might not even find your business in the
      first place. And you certainly DO NOT want that!
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Local SEO Guide, “The prominence of review
      isn’t particularly shocking, as it’s a way for Google to
      crowdsource ranking factors, it’s hard to spam, and the
      most problematic type of abuse is illegal.”
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      The <b>second</b> reason is that reviews boost your business’s
      local SEO. You might already know Google’s proximity
      factor for filtering local search results. Good reviews
      are the factors that impact Google’s search results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s an easy example for you to understand. Imagine
      you are in a new city looking for the best store to buy
      a new dress. When you search in Google for the same, you
      will have options closest to you. But if a shop has
      better ratings than the one closest to you, Google will
      recommend that shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Managing your online reputation and brand visibility
      will help you reach potential customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are wondering why Google produces such results,
      the main reason is to provide the best results against
      your searches and reviews.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The <b>third</b> reason is that reviews are an opportunity to
      get better! Organizations usually conduct customer
      satisfaction surveys to know how customers feel about
      their products and services! Reviews are the same. You
      get positive, neutral, and negative comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      So engage with the reviews and take full advantage of
      the opportunity.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Why do we need to reply to Google reviews?</h2>
    <p>
      Google ranks those businesses that are reliable and
      trustworthy. As Google wants to provide the best result
      to a search query, it looks for quality also.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we respond to Google reviews, we help Google see us
      as a trustworthy place of business, boosting our
      credibility online and offline.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also greatly affects local SEO. So, if you have
      Google reviews, then make sure you reply to them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>How to Respond to Positive Google Reviews?</h2>
    <p>
      Positive reviews make you happy and keep you motivated.
      Customers love your business, and they tell their
      friends about it. So, you must acknowledge your
      delighted customers by replying to their positive
      feedback. The following ways will help you create that
      bond between your ‘happy’ customer and you.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Personalise the review:</h3>
    <p>
      When replying, personalise it using the person’s name,
      mention the product, and emphasise thanking them.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Timely response:</h3>
    <p>
      Respond quickly to the feedback if possible. The
      customer has gone out of their way to leave a review.
      Your responses promptly create a good impression and
      sense of acknowledgement for the customer.
    </p>
    <h3>3. State your happiness:</h3>
    <p>
      Construct your reply to show you are happy to help/serve
      them and appreciate them taking their time to share a
      review.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Match reviewers’ energy:</h3>
    <p>
      Try to respond in the same energy band as a customer.
      For example, if the customer has responded with
      enthusiasm, be sure to respond to him with great energy.

      to Positive Reviews
    </h2>

      reviews:

    <ul>

        name, then ensure to mention that name in your
        response.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add local business keywords to your response. These
        keywords could be your business name, location,
        products, and services.
      </li>

        make the customer feel valued and add a personal touch
        to your response.

        services relevant to the customer.

    </ul>

  <div>
    <h2>Best Examples for Positive Review Response</h2>
    <p>
      You can use the following as a guide or as a template
      for replying to positive reviews:
    </p>
    <h3> Example 1</h3>
    <p>

      experience. They even mention the product or the
      service. They also praise the entire experience during
      their purchase. How do you respond?
    </p>
    <p>Your response should emphasise thanking them.</p>
    <br />
    <h4>It can go like this – </h4>
    <p>

      their name and thanks them. It is personalised and is
      professional. It also prompts the customer to visit
      again.
    </p>
    <h4>Another way to reply to this positive review </h4>
    <p>
      Dear (customer’s name), thank you for saying (repeat the
      appreciation here). It truly made our day. We are
      grateful to you. We hope to serve you with a delightful
      experience again. Thank you!
    </p>
    <p>
      This response shows how happy you were that the customer
      was happy and you are ready to do it again.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Example 2</h3>
    <p>
      A customer had a great experience. They explain the
      entire process and the salesperson’s name. They even
      gave you a five-star rating. How do you respond?
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>It can go like this – </h4>
    <p>
      Greet them (Hi/Hello), thank you. (Saleperson’s name) is
      highly passionate about his/her job. He/She is
      knowledgeable and loves assisting customers. Thank you
      for your business! Visit us again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This response resonates with the customer as it uses
      their name and the salesperson’s name. It is
      personalised and is professional. It also shows you
      value your employees.

    <br />
    <h4>Other ways you can respond are:</h4>

        you for using our (product/service)”
      </li>
      <li>
        Show how you found the right (service/product) without
        exaggerating. “We are glad we have the (product
        name/service) for you.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>How to Respond to Neutral Google Reviews</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      You can respond to neutral Google reviews as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Acknowledge and thank the reviewer: I appreciate the
      customer’s taking the time to write a review.
      Acknowledge that you have seen the feedback.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>1. Emphasise:</h3>
    <p>
      Emphasise the valid points from the customer’s review.
      If they have a valid point or reason, assure them their
      changes will be done soon and take the necessary action
      to improve your product or service.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>2. Turn a Neutral review into a positive:</h3>
    <p>
      If your customer has written a neutral review, try to
      turn the average experience into a good one by offering
      discounts on your next purchase or complimentary
      service.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>3. Upsell or cross-sell:</h3>
    <p>
      If a customer has an average experience, but you think
      the other products or services might make them happier,
      then offer them a deal on the upgrade. Suggest other
      products or services to the customer that can prove to
      be better and an upgrade.
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2>How to Respond to Negative Google Reviews</h2>
    <p>
      These are a few things to keep in mind while responding
      to negative feedback:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take your time for assessment:</li>
      <li>
        Do not panic, and take your time to understand and
        review the issue the customer faced.
      </li>
      <li>Check if it was your fault or not.</li>
      <li>Try to come up with a solution.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>1. Acknowledge and be apologetic:</h3>
    <p>
      Acknowledge the customer’s review. Apologies and let
      them know you have read the review, value your
      customers’ opinions, and apologies for their bad
      experience.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>2. Ask for contact details:</h3>
    <p>
      Ask them for their contact details to share with
      relevant teams or used to contact and discuss solutions.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>3. Take matters private:</h3>
    <p>
      Do not discuss the problems or the offers you will make
      to the customer in public comments. Take matters private
      on call or email and provide a solution to customers to
      try to make things right.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>4. Provide a productive step:</h3>
    <p>
      Inform customers that you are working on making your
      product or service better using their feedback.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>
      Best Tips or strategies you should follow while replying
      to negative reviews
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be polite and professional in your reply. Any impolite
        response will reflect negatively on your part.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid showing your emotions. It is not about how you
        are feeling. It is about your customer’s experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apologies to the customer, but only if it is
        necessary. Focus on the fact that your customer is not
        happy. Empathise with the customer and make them feel
        heard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure it is productive and restores faith in the
        customer’s mind. It will also show your potential
        customers your willingness to take action.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a customer has not mentioned the reason for their
        frustration, simply ask them but avoid taking guesses.
        Ask them to share their reason and try resolving it.
      </li>
      <li>
        In case of fake reviews, please report them using the
        correct channels.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Examples for Negative Review Response</h2>
    <p>Some of the examples are as follows:</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>
      I’m sorry to hear that you had a bad experience. We

    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>How should we deal with fake reviews?</h2>
    <p>
      Fake reviews can seriously hurt your business
      reputation, whether good or bad. Some indicators used to
      find whether the reviews are fake or not are as follows:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>They are extremely positive or negative.</li>
      <li>
        The same way of phrasing a sentence can be seen
        throughout.
      </li>
      <li>
        They do not contain any details of the person’s
        product or service.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ul>
    <p>
      In such cases, you can ask Google to review it; if the
      review goes against the guidelines, they will remove it
      for you. Also, remember to reply to the fake review. An
      example is shared below.
    </p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Hi, (Fake Customer Name),
      <br />
      We take these matters very seriously. Unfortunately, we
      have no record or recollection of your experience with
      us, nor can we verify anything about your identity from
      your name in our records.
      <br />
      We want to investigate further if you have done business
      with us. Please contact (Manager’s Name) immediately at
      (Email/Phone Number) so we can resolve this issue.

    <h2>Why do we need to reply to Facebook Feedback?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      While running a business on Facebook, you might consider
      taking your reviews seriously, as they greatly impact
      your presence on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facebook reviews appear in your business page’s ‘Reviews
      or Recommendations section’. Compared to Google,
      Facebook can turn off the reviews, but it is recommended
      not to do it as reviews impact your potential customers,
      and it is one of the ways to establish your brand’s
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are running a Facebook business page, reviews
      are one of the ways of introducing and educating people
      on Facebook about your business. Managing the Facebook
      business page and working continuously to improve your
      overall public image is important.
    </p>

      How to respond to positive Facebook Feedback Example
    </h2>
    <p>
      As a business owner, reviewing and replying to reviews
      shared about your product or services is important.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Always address the customer by name to add a more
        personalised touch to your comment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Acknowledge the review and thank the customer for
        sharing their feedback. Rather than just writing
        ‘Thank you’, write a more personalised reply
        appreciating the customer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quick replies play a major role as the customer goes
        out of their way to write and boost your public image.
        Always try to reply as quickly as possible. It makes
        customers feel wanted as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always try to retain the customers by welcoming them
        back soon. Try to do so by providing exclusive offers
        and discounts only for them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Some of the examples of responses to positive Facebook
      feedback are:
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>
      Thank you, &lt;Customer Name&gt;, for the amazing
      review! We put in the work to keep you and all our
      clients happy. We hope to see you again. Have a nice day
      ahead!”
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Example 2</h3>

      How to respond to neutral Facebook Feedback Example
    </h2>
    <p>
      In case you get a 3-star or a neutral review, try to
      write a response based on the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank the customer for providing you with the chance to
      provide them with a service or product. Let them know
      that you are thankful for the review.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to find out the customers’ issue, which turned a
      potential good review into an average one. If a customer
      has a valid point, acknowledge it and inform them you
      are working on the feedback to apply the changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to convert the average experience to a good one by
      offering them better products, upgrades, discounts, and
      exchange offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inform customers of other ranges and product varieties
      that can improve their experience.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some examples:</p>

      our belt, we have seen firsthand the benefits of
      hospitality marketing solutions to hospitality
      businesses of all sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most important reasons to have hospitality
      advisors is that they can help develop a strategic plan
      for your hotel that includes hospitality marketing
      solutions. The plan is achieved after a thorough
      understanding of your hotel’s strengths and weaknesses
      and the competitive landscape in your market.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good hospitality marketing agency will help you
      identify growth opportunities and develop strategies to
      achieve your business goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to their expertise in hospitality
      operations, hospitality advisors can also provide a
      valuable outside perspective. They can help you to
      identify areas where your hotel is falling short and
      develop solutions to improve your performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, having hospitality advisors can be a valuable
      investment for any hotel. With expert advice and
      guidance, hospitality advisors can help you improve the
      profitability and efficiency of your hotel and, in
      return, achieve your long-term business goals.

    data: `<div>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Why is opening a cloud kitchen a good idea?
    </strong>
    <br />
    Here’s what happens exactly in a cloud kitchen model:
    Orders come in, meals are cooked, packed, and then whisked
    immediately to their delivery locations by the assigned
    fleet.
    <br />
    Why does this work?
    <b>
      Because you’re cutting costs on front-of-house
      activities and concentrating on your food.
    </b>
    With the availability of third-party services and the
    growing comfort of mobile ordering, this model seems just
    right to experiment with. There are more benefits involved
    like:
  </p>

  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Lower real estate costs</h2>
    <p>
      Since you’re removing table servicing out of the
      equation and offering a delivery-only service, you’ll
      save a huge amount on real estate costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cloud kitchens release you from the obligation of having
      space in a high-visibility area. Rather than paying for
      accessibility, better-developed complexes, or even a
      large parking space, you can concentrate on having
      enough kitchen space in a decent area near your target
      market.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Better expansion opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      The best thing about cloud kitchens is that you don’t
      need heavy investments to begin. You can start small but
      expand fast. Once you build a brand and get loyal
      customers, expanding to new localities and even new menu
      varieties gets easier. Let’s take the example of Faasos,
      today it runs 160+ kitchens and 4 brands including
      Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, and Firangi Bake.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h3>Saving on overhead costs</h3>
    <p>
      With a cloud kitchen, you save so much on overhead
      costs. You don’t need client-facing staff, decoration or
      space entrance, parking area, etc. Even if you have
      lower-priced menu items, your profit margins are likely
      to be better.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h3>How does a cloud kitchen work?</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud kitchens are centralized licensed commercial food
      production facilities where anywhere from one or two to
      dozens of restaurants rent space to prepare
      delivery-optimized menu items. One restaurant may run
      multiple brands or virtual restaurants, all operating
      under one roof, or the kitchen may be run like an
      incubator, shared by different purveyors. Picture a
      large warehouse with numerous stations
      (mini-restaurants) of stainless steel prep tables, hood
      vents, stoves, ovens, and sinks, each with its own
      orders coming in directly from customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cloud kitchen menu items are optimized for ease of
      production and reliability of food quality upon
      delivery. Often physically located in out-of-town
      industrial complexes, cloud kitchens may offer driver
      parking, driver waiting areas (often with screens to
      monitor order times), and check-in stations for seamless
      driver pick-up. All are designed to get food out the
      door and into the customer’s hands as fast as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cloud kitchens are uniquely tech-enabled. They take
      advantage of the now ubiquitous food delivery apps on
      your smartphone, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub, and
      Doordash.
      <br /> In doing so, they use large amounts of data to
      determine what types of foods to produce for specific
      neighborhoods and when the demand is likely to be
      greatest. For example, hot wings tend to be really
      popular between 11 pm-2 am near college campuses. This
      data is fueling rapid adaptation and optimization,
      almost in real time.
      <br /> As the technology has matured, additional
      services have emerged to aggregate the various delivery
      apps into one portal, for easier production of multiple
      orders and delivery coordination as well as smart food
      purchasing and production software for decreased food
      waste and increased per-meal unit economics. We have
      only seen the tip of the iceberg of innovation in this
      space.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Competing in a crowded digital marketplace</h2>
    <p>
      With no physical location, cloud kitchens don’t benefit
      from walk-in traffic. You are competing exclusively in a
      crowded online marketplace. The good news is, if your
      product is good enough, it should rise to the top thanks
      to social proof like good reviews and word-of-mouth
      referrals. But you may find yourself having to pay for
      visibility on these platforms. That is, after all, how
      they make their money. You should be aware of this
      potential added cost, especially at the beginning,
      before you’re able to develop your own loyal following.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Food quality and food safety</h2>
    <p>
      With a delivery-only brand, your reputation relies on
      the food getting to the customer in perfect condition.
      Getting this right is the only way to get repeat orders.
      There are significant challenges in keeping the product
      at proper temperatures so it arrives as intended to the
      customer. Not just at the right temperature for them to
      best enjoy it but also to ensure it is safe to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means testing out different types of packaging and
      potentially investing in containers that are more
      expensive and harder to source. This is a cost that can
      quickly add up when you are pumping out a high volume of
      orders, but it is a vital consideration. Soggy, lukewarm
      food will guarantee failure. And one food-borne illness
      or outbreak and your brand is toast.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Local regulation and licensure</h2>
    <p>
      Food production is largely regulated at the local level
      by your health department. Since cloud kitchens are so
      new, regulators may be unfamiliar with the concept. They
      may start hitting you with unexpected requirements, or
      start treating you like a full-service restaurant.
      <br />
      Agents will want to see that food is being safely
      stored, produced, packaged, and delivered, which may
      require the production of <b>HACCP</b> and other
      production plans for review. Also, having multiple
      tenants producing under one roof increases the
      complexity of who is licensed to produce and distribute
      food. You must be prepared to go the extra mile in
      showing them that your operation is safe and
      responsible.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>What’s behind the cloud kitchen trend?</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud kitchens started popping up in the early 2010s in
      response to increased demand for high-quality meal
      delivery and rising rents in city center locations.
      Green Summit Group opened one of the first cloud
      kitchens in New York City in 2013, and has grown out to
      four locations across two cities.
      <br /> Many more start-ups have followed suit and as we
      enter a new decade, cloud kitchens are becoming big
      business, with venture capital pouring into start-ups
      specifically aiming to take advantage of this new
      market.
      <br /> The trend is driven by the coming of age of
      millennials with disposable income demanding digital,
      mobile-friendly solutions. And this will only get more
      pronounced as the next generation, who have grown up
      with the internet and smartphones, enters the
      marketplace (sorry boomers). Looking further forward
      advances in kitchen automation, drone delivery, and the
      continued growth of the gig economy look to give cloud
      kitchens more of an advantage by lowering their costs
      even further.
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Let’s take a closer look at the factors affecting the
        trend.
      </li>
      <li>Real estate prices in urban areas</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      As urban real estate prices continue their upward trend,
      delivery-only kitchens are able to take advantage of
      their ‘virtual’ nature. The only restriction on their
      location is that they must be within a realistic
      delivery distance of enough hungry customers.
      <br /> Companies like Kitchen United are focussing on
      light industrial areas outside dense urban centers but
      near enough to satisfy the demand of residential areas.
      Large warehouses at low rents are the perfect venues to
      house expansive shared kitchens if you have the capital
      to outfit them. Using demand data collected from
      delivery apps, they are able to determine the best
      locations to serve particular neighborhoods.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Increase in demand for delivery</h2>
    <p>
      Food delivery is set to grow to a $200 billion industry
      by 2025, due to shifting changes in behavior, with
      nearly half of consumers preferring to eat at home. Uber
      is even more optimistic than most, valuing the market at
      $795 billion.
      <br /> With 91 million monthly users, Uber Eats is
      currently the most popular food delivery app. Consumers
      are increasingly willing to pay a significant amount for
      the convenience of having their food delivered.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Increase in on-demand contract workers</h2>
    <p>
      With the gig or sharing economy in full swing and
      expected to hit $335 billion by 2025, we’ve seen an
      increase in on-demand contract workers. The number of
      people working as ride-share drivers, delivery drivers,
      and remote workers is on the rise, offering low-cost
      labor with no strings attached from an employer’s point
      of view. However the stability of the gig economy is
      still unknown. California recently passed a law that
      requires that some companies treat contract workers as
      employees.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>
      Emerging technologies decrease the cost of delivery
    </h2>
    <p>
      Looking further forward, drone delivery and kitchen
      automation are set to disrupt the standard restaurant
      model further. Robot kitchens are on the rise and drone
      delivery is poised to break through, with only regional
      regulations standing in its way.
      <br /> Tech-minded shared kitchens are perfectly
      positioned to take advantage of these advances. They are
      much more able and likely to adapt quickly to new
      technology, giving them a further edge over storefront
      restaurants.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Access to user data and real-time adaptability</h2>
    <p>
      Because they are designed with tech in mind, cloud
      kitchens can optimize processes, ordering, and staff
      scheduling based on consumer behavior. The menu can also
      be adapted to suit demand and increase margins,
      optimizing the model over time.
      <br /> Not being tied to a physical location means you
      can change the menu or operating times to suit business
      needs without as much of an impact on customer
      satisfaction. This can also help to decrease food waste,
      as you can be smarter with ordering and prep decisions.
      <br /> In fact, virtual restaurants are so adaptable,
      you can even launch a brand just for a season. For
      instance, you could launch a healthy salad brand for the
      summer and a hearty poutine concept for the winter
      months, allowing you to take advantage of the seasonal
      demand for each type of food without enduring any
      downturn.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>
      Digital brand awareness without high marketing spend
    </h2>
    <p>
      Virtual restaurant brands can gain quick exposure
      through delivery apps, rather than having to market
      themselves. Although a new virtual restaurant concept
      will have to pay for visibility, which is part of the
      delivery app business model, this can still work out
      cheaper overall, especially if you are creative about
      building your brand.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>
      What are the potential challenges with ghost kitchens?
    </h2>
    <p>
      With any new technology, there are going to be certain
      drawbacks along with the benefits. Here are some of the
      potential challenges that come with running a cloud
      kitchen.
      <br /> Working with on-demand staff running a cloud
      kitchen, you may be more inclined to hire on-demand
      staff to control margins. While this can save on your
      wage bill, it comes with some caveats. Since staff won’t
      be interacting with guests or getting tips, it could
      feel more like working in a factory than a hospitality
      job. Of course, you can try to boost morale and motivate
      staff in other ways, but it may be more difficult to
      build a brand culture if you are not attracting the top
      food service talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hiring on-demand staff also carries risks in terms of
      food safety and consistency, both vital to successful
      food businesses. Can you be sure these workers have
      adequate training? If you want to invest in training, it
      makes more sense to hire permanent staff members. There
      is a trade-off here that you will have to work on to try
      to figure out the best balance between on-demand workers
      and permanent staff.

    <h2>Reliance on third-party delivery apps</h2>
    <p>
      For all the benefits of using delivery apps, it’s never
      a good business decision to rely on one source of
      customers. The high fees can also eat into your margins
      and you have little control over last-mile delivery
      which can affect the quality of the food and put your
      reputation at risk. One way to counter this is to offer
      your own delivery service, but this comes with higher
      marketing costs and logistical complications.

      All You Need To Know About How To Open A Cloud Kitchen
      In India
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this article, we will take you through the
      investments, licenses required, type of location, and
      everything else you need to know about how to open your
      very own cloud kitchen.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      1. Deciding The Location Of The Cloud Kitchen Restaurant
    </h3>
    <p>
      The primary reason behind the low investment needed to
      open a cloud kitchen is the real estate cost. Location
      is the biggest differentiator that reduces the cost of
      opening a cloud kitchen as compared to a traditional
      dine-in restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        In the cloud kitchen model, the location doesn’t have
        to do anything with footfalls, parking space, and
        high-end sites. However, it does have a lot to do with
        proper sanitation and water supply with low rentals.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the location should be chosen based on the
      customer demography and the type of food product that
      you are selling. The cloud kitchen should be located
      where there is a high demand for the food that you’d be
      offering. For instance
      <br /> This article will tell you how to decide the best
      location for opening your cloud kitchen business.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>2. Implementing The Online Food Ordering</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have decided on the location, you need to
      decide on the technology to accept orders. There are
      many online ordering and delivery platforms such as
      Swiggy, Zomato, Foodpanda, etc. that accept online
      orders on your behalf and also deliver the food to your
      customers. These companies usually charge 18-30% of your
      revenue per order. There is also a one-time integration
      fee involved for some FoodTech companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        Since a cloud kitchen relies solely on its online
        presence to draw in customers, a website with the
        option to order food online is an absolute must.
      </b>
      Various website developers can build a well-optimized
      website for you. However, you can also go for the
      services provided at POSist, which also gets integrated
      with your POS software, which further increases your
      efficiency in taking orders and managing customers.
      Also, customers can track their orders on a real-time
      basis.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>3. Acquiring The Licenses For The Online Kitchens</h3>
    <p>
      Licensing is an integral part of setting up a
      restaurant. Few licenses are essential to procure in the
      first month of operations for a hassle-free business.
      <b>
        These are FSSAI licenses, GST Registration, Municipal
        health trade licenses, fire licenses, etc.
      </b>
      It is advised to hire an agency to apply for all the
      permits because it is the most tedious and
      time-consuming task. Apart from this rest of the permits
      would cost you around Rs 10,000 (if the FSSAI license is
      applied for one year) Here is a complete list of all the
      permissions required for opening a food business in
      India and the steps to procuring them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      4. Kitchen Equipment, Raw Materials, And Packaging
      Needed For A Cloud Kitchen
    </h3>
    <p>
      The cost of setting up the kitchen will vary depending
      on the cuisine and food you are offering. For example,
      the cost of setting up a cloud kitchen that wants to
      serve items like Burger, Pizza, Pasta, and Sandwiches
      will not cost more than Rs 2,00,000.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>
        If you spend wisely on equipment by procuring new
        electronic items and old equipment such as tables,
        racks, and storing shelves, you can save up a lot of
        money.
      </b>
      The cost can go up because of the heavy equipment like a
      chimney, deep refrigerators, and burners. If you are
      planning to run multiple brands from the same kitchen,
      you can leverage the same kitchen equipment and
      resources for multiple brands. This would help you save
      on the equipment cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is how you can choose the kitchen equipment for
      your cloud kitchen
    </p>
    <p>
      Raw materials required to start the cloud kitchen
      operations depend on the type of food you’re offering.
      It is important to choose the right vendors at this
      stage for the raw materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should allocate an extra budget for packaging as it
      plays a crucial role in creating a brand recall for the
      customers. The packaging must be sturdy to preserve the
      quality of the food during the delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you are no longer able to provide a physical guest
      experience, packaging should leave a good impression on
      the minds of the customers. Ensure that the packaging
      contains your restaurant’s logo and reflects the theme
      and concept of your restaurant.
    </p>

      great customer experience here.

    <h3>
      5. Staff Requirement In A Cloud Kitchen Restaurant
    </h3>
    <p>
      The secret sauce behind a successful restaurant is the
      team that works for it, with the Chef being the most
      critical part of the team, as they not only prepare the
      food but also help in designing the menu.
      <b>
        In an online kitchen, a minimum of five employees is
        required.
      </b>
      You’d need at least two chefs, two helpers, and one
      housekeeper. The salary of the staff depends on their
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average salary of the Chef at Commis level 1 is Rs
      14000- Rs 15000, while that of helpers and other staff
      salary ranges between Rs 6000- Rs 8000 based on their
      work. Apart from the kitchen staff, two employees at the
      delivery and one at the counter for receiving online and
      telephonic orders are required. Here we would also like
      to recommend you to partner with the third-party
      delivery services which work on a per-order basis.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>6. Staff Uniform For Cloud Kitchen Employees</h3>
    <p>
      For a cloud kitchen, one may feel that a staff uniform
      is not required. However, it is still heavily
      recommended to have a dress code for maintaining
      discipline, cleanliness, and hygiene.
      <b>
        Also, provide your cloud kitchen staff with essential
        hygiene and safety standards equipment such as masks,
        hair caps, and gloves.
      </b>
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      7. Point Of Sale Technology Needed For A Cloud Kitchen
    </h3>
    <p>
      The entire online food ordering and delivery system is
      heavily dependent on the proper acceptance of food
      orders.
      <b>
        It is also essential to keep track of the number of
        orders incoming from the various online ordering
        platforms. Tracking of orders and detailed reporting
        is essential for the smooth functioning of
        restaurants.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Select a POS that is customized to suit the requirements
      of the online ordering website. The one we recommend is
      our very own POSist software, which is
      hardware-independent and completely browser-based. You
      can use any web-enabled device such as a computer,
      laptop, tablet, or even your mobile to generate the
      bills.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>8. Mobile Phones And Other Miscellaneous Items</h3>
    <p>
      <b>
        An online kitchen requires a board line, mobile
        phones, high-speed internet, stationery, small
        counters, and chairs.
      </b>
      Apart from that, you can also get a Cloud Telephony
      subscription that ensures that no call gets missed. You
      can also record the call for training purposes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>9. Marketing Required For A Cloud Kitchen</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="/industries-we-serve/cloud-kitchen-marketing-agency/">Proper marketing and advertising</a> are
      essential to the success of a restaurant. For a cloud
      kitchen, marketing becomes even more necessary as it
      becomes the single source of getting orders. Since you
      are not spending on location and other maintenance
      costs, you can keep a sum aside for marketing.
      <b>
        Online marketing works in favor of cloud kitchens
        quite well.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing you need to do is to get your restaurant
      registered on restaurant listing and review sites such
      as Zomato, Tripadvisor, Burrp, etc., and encourage
      positive reviews from your regulars. You can also try
      Facebook for advertising exclusive deals and discounts.

  <p>
    A website is a must if you own a restaurant and want to
    create a digital identity for your business. A website is
    important to interact with customers and attract potential
    customers through the website. Therefore, the website for
    any restaurant needs to be interactive. However, there are
    so many different website platforms that it becomes
    difficult to choose a feature-rich platform that provides
    you with all the features. One of the two most popular
    platforms for a restaurant website is HTML and WordPress,
    and people are usually confused between the two. Both
    types of websites have their advantage, but which is best
    for a restaurant? Let’s find out.
  </p>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Restaurant website based on HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is one of the most basic ways to create a website,
      but it can be customized to your favorite design through
      CSS. A restaurant website based on HTML will come with
      the most simple-to-use user interface, where you can
      easily provide textual, video, and image forms of
      information to the viewers. If you want your customers
      to open the website and other pages on it with speed,
      then HTML is the best option. You can provide the
      details of your restaurant, images of the recipes, pages
      to introduce your team, and more.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Pros</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to use and navigate for users</li>
      <li>
        Can easily integrate images, video, and text to show
        and describe various recipes and dishes
      </li>
      <li>
        Requires fewer server resources, so your website will
        open faster and will be up almost every time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Takes less time to develop, and the cost of creating
        an HTML website for a restaurant would less.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Cons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lack of many features like social media integration,
        animation, themes, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provides a basic website that does not create an
        interactive experience for any restaurant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Does not allow a blogging engine, where the restaurant
        owner can easily interact with customers for feedback
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Restaurant website based on WordPress</h2>
    <p>
      WordPress is one of the most popular website platforms
      and is being used by some of the most popular
      restaurants in the world, such as Chez Panisse and
      Gotham Bar & Grill. With a WordPress website, you can do
      almost anything, limited only by the imagination of the
      restaurant owner. It is very easy to use and provides
      many features that increase the interaction with the
      potential customers of your
      <a href="/industries-we-serve/restaurant-marketing-agency/">
      restaurant marketing.
      </a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Pros</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Restaurant owners can easily use tools and add things
        to websites like post press releases, announcements,
        or events immediately. Formatting and editing on a
        WordPress website are much easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is faster and includes all the features of HTML
        with additional website-building tools of WordPress.
        It makes it easier to design the website.
      </li>
      <li>
        It can add maps and directions to the website, making
        it easier for customers to locate the restaurant.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can integrate the social media components to
        interact with the customer online and in real-time.
      </li>
      <li>
        It also provides a reservation engine, which can be
        used to make reservations for restaurant tables
        online.
      </li>
      <li>
        Menus listed on the WordPress website can be easily
        edited and downloaded on users’ systems or phones.

        becomes easier.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div>
    <h2>Cons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lacks quick loading speed as that of HTML</li>
      <li>
        The cost of creating a WordPress website is more
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Verdict</h2>
    <p>
      If you own a restaurant, a WordPress website makes a lot
      more sense as it allows you to interact with customers
      in multiple ways and guide them to your restaurant.
      Additionally, new plugins and features are regularly
      added to the platform, which helps to make the
      restaurant website even more attractive.

    data: `<div>
  <div>
    <h2>What is a Brand Guide?</h2>
    <p>
      A one-page document highlighting the creative assets of
      a brand, like a logo, design, colour, typography, and
      brand philosophy to make customers aware and educated
      about the brand and at the same time, a branding guide
      for hotels strikes an emotional connection with them. It
      serves as a manual of guidelines a hotel brand is based
      on to ensure that it creates a brand perception of the
      business, in this case, a hotel in the eyes of the
      customers.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>
      Why do you need a brand guide for hotels and
      restaurants?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Each business is different, but each requires a brand
      identity and image so that people can identify it across
      all channels, both physically and digitally. When we
      speak of the hotel industry, a brand guide plays a
      quintessential role in making your hotel different and
      appealing to tourists, visitors, and potential customers
      than others. If you don’t follow certain brand
      guidelines you will never be able to make a lasting
      impression in the market, nobody will recognize you, and
      nobody will remember it.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>
      Let us understand the components of a brand guide with
      examples:
    </h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Brand voice</h2>
    <p>
      Brand voice is the message that the brand wants to
      deliver and establish in the market, especially in the
      eyes of the customers. A good example of a changing
      brand voice came from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company in
      2015 when they revealed a new logo and brand voice and
      promoted it across all channels to meet their guests.
      They made this change after 32 years.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>
      Take the example of any brand that you come across, you
      will find that there is a certain font, a type of
      structure they are following that not only makes them
      stand out from others but, at the same time, it offers
      them a new identity so much so that people instantly
      relate to a certain brand. You won’t believe it, but
      that’s how much the typography of a brand has ingrained
      into our minds.
      <br /> For example, to understand the logo and
      typography, let’s consider Park Hyatt, a sub-brand of
      the Hyatt Hotel Group. The typography is sleek and at
      the same time, it restores elegance in it. They use the
      serif font and the use of lines replicates strength.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Colour palette</h2>
    <p>
      When I say red you can immediately think of Zomato, when
      I say Swiggy you have an orange colour logo forming in
      your head, but it’s not even a typical orange but
      somewhere between red and yellow. Have you ever come
      across a brand that has multiple colour usage in its
      design, symbols, and logos? Go on, take a minute, think
      about it –<br /> You may not be able to think of any
      brand after I gave you the example of single-color
      brands, but actually, there are many, do you know what
      separates them? They are following a colour palette.
      <br /> Let alone if we Take the example of hotels, let’s
      talk about the Plaza Hotel in New York City, It has been
      a prominent location for many film shoots, The Plaza
      uses pink and its shades to add a touch of sweetness,
      and the hotel is known to use every shade of pink to
      replicate a feeling and spark a vibe for their guests.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Imagery</h2>
    <p>
      Pay attention, here we are not talking about a single
      picture that speaks for the brand, but all the visuals
      that come together to create brand imagery in a variety
      of ways. Now, these images can be used in multiple
      channels, from billboards to Instagram, in print ads on
      websites as well.
      <br /> When you are a hotel brand, such pictures can
      trigger your customers or a tourist to remember you and
      make a mental note of it, so the next time they are
      booking a hotel they will remember you. Remember, these
      are not random pictures but convey an emotion, most
      importantly the brand values. Many hotels use
      single-colour imagery because it retains sophistication
      and directly speaks to the eyes of potential customers.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Tonality</h2>
    <p>
      Every hotel has a distinctive personality, for example,
      if you have to describe your hotel to a stranger for the
      first time, how will you do it? It is often suggested in
      hotel branding, that the owners must avoid using jargon
      and buzzwords.
      <br /> Your hotel’s persona should bring a specific
      image to mind. Having clarity can help you create good
      marketing creatives and copies, but not only that, it
      resembles one of the main brand guidelines.
      <br /> A subtle example of this would be the Aman –
      Luxury hotel, The hotel brand maximize the use of
      graphic images and only uses simple snippets but
      on-point information text, and again it is beautiful in
      its own way. The design sets the tone of the entire
      hotel chain.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2>Brand Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Like every individual has their way of doing things,
      this same formula applies to hotels and most importantly
      brands. So why certain brands do something and why they
      do it in a certain way replicates the brand philosophy,
      and that’s a pivotal part of the brand guide. People
      visiting your hotel must believe in its philosophy of
      doing things and how it caters to its customers.
      <br /> Another good example comes from the Ritz-Carlton
      hotels making an art form of guest service. They stated
      that a great service philosophy always empowers
      employees to demonstrate a higher degree of trust and
      work toward guest satisfaction.
      <br /> At last, we can easily conclude that a brand
      guide is a significant tool in marketing. If you are a
      hotel owner and also struggling to set brand guidelines
      to create an identity. Fielmente as a digital marketing
      agency specializing in the hotel industry will help you
      formulate your entire brand identity and create the most
      amazing brand guide which will not only appeal to your
      target audience and customers but will have all the
      components from typography, imagery, brand voice, colour
      palette and philosophy catered. Get in touch with us to

<p>As digital marketing is shifting rapidly, your hotel must use the best marketing concepts to drive new
  business. Online marketing through SEO, content, social media, paid campaigns, chatbots, and reputation management
  could greatly impact your hotel business. Oh, wait! Your website’s user experience is also important. But, don’t
  worry, Fielmente is here.</p>
<p>To help you take your restaurant to the next level, we’ve suggested some creative ideas that would require little or
  no budget.</p>
<p><b>Do a Q&A session with an industry expert at your hotel to drive marketing results.</b></p>
<p>Create a Q&A or a podcast with an industry expert with a big social following. After the interview, post their
  responses on your social media, company’s blog, or newsletters.</p>
<p></p>This type of content marketing works because the experts you interview might act as a brand preachers and bring
their audience to you. Also, you can conduct live YouTube sessions and ask the audience to submit their questions for
better engagement.</p>

<br />
<h2>Optimize your hotel’s website for voice search.</h2>
<p>Event Planners and potential clients increasingly use voice search to get quick answers. So when you ask, “ Hey Siri,
  how many rooms are in the XYZ Hotel?” you need to make sure Siri knows the answer.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customize your SEO strategy and content so that modern speakers can easily tell the answers.</li>
  <li>Make the FAQs on your website as clear as possible so that search engines can find the answers properly.</li>
  <li>Find out the keywords your target consumers are searching for.</li>
  <li>Use alternative tags and descriptions on your images and all parts of your website to permit easy scanning and to
    occur through voice search.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>Create hotel ambassadors.</h2>

<p>Sometimes a simple marketing idea for hotels comes from a simple hack. So reach out to your hotel employees and get
  this strategy done.</p>
<p><b>Let them post on social media.</b></p>
<p>Choose an in-house ambassador to reach people, interact with potential customers, and share unique thoughts about
  your
  business. This will help solidify the brand value more. These optimistic brand messages on social media will help
  build
  a well-known and respectable image.</p>
<br />
<h2>Create “blesuire” experiences at your hotel</h2>
<p>What’s that? – Business + Leisure. Remember that event planners need to have meetings for business events, and your
  hotel’s services can help them achieve that.</p>
<p>These days, travelers seek remarkable local experiences while on their business trips. Business travelers look
  forward
  to hotels that can host the program and offer special services like a gym, spa, sporting activities, social happy
  hours,
  and other luxuries. A taste of regional culture, great food, and eye-catching sights don’t hurt either.</p>
<br />
<h3>Offer upgrades to business travelers.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Extravagance amenities</li>
  <li>Free ride to a major convention</li>
  <li>A free beverage at the hotel bar or restaurant</li>
  <li>Tickets to reservations at high-end restaurants</li>
  <li>Access to a local music venue</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>An add-on or upgrade can close the deal for guests. Weave in tailored add-ons like these when clients go to
  book:</p>
<br />
<h2>Post testimonials and reviews on your hotel’s website.</h2>
<p>Your possible clients will read the feedback no matter what, so you might as well place them on your social
  media! You can ask past guests for custom reviews, or you can take the quotes from review sites like
  TripAdvisor.</p>

      "8 Marketing Strategies for Food & Beverage Industry to Plan in 2022",
    link: "8-marketing-strategies-for-food-beverage-industry-to-plan-in-2022",
    data: `<p>This article is designed for any manager in the Food and Beverage Industry who wants to grow their business by
  executing a successful marketing strategy. This quick guide will help you plan your marketing strategy for 2022.</p>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>1. Conduct a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats) Analysis</h2>
  <p>Before you even start planning the 2022 marketing strategy you need to conduct a SWOT analysis for your food and
    beverage business so that you have an idea of the status of your company.</p>
  <p>Use this information to decide which products or services would contribute significantly to the growth of your
    company in 2022 and which should be discontinued.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>2. Create an Objective Statement for Yourself</h2>
  <p>Every marketing plan should have a clear objective that is specific, measurable, and achievable. Once you conduct a
    SWOT analysis and identify the areas where you need to make improvements in your business, create an objective
    statement for yourself.</p>
  <p>For example, your company is planning to roll out a new range of products by 2022. Your objective statement could
    be: “To launch a new range of products to increase the revenue from this segment by 30% in 2022”.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>3. Develop a Target Audience Profile</h2>
  <p>A lot of work goes into developing a target audience profile. The reason behind developing a target audience
    profile is to ensure that your marketing strategy is successful, and you are able to target the right audience for
    each product or service that you develop in the future.</p>
  <p>A target audience profile can be developed in many ways. One way is to look at the characteristics of a person who
    bought a product or service in the past and find out if they are likely to buy that product or service again.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>4. Determine the Market Share For Each Product or Service</h2>
  <p>Determine the market share for each of your products or services so that you have a true indication of the sales
    potential of each product or service.</p>
  <p>For example, take a look at your company’s current market share for each product. It might be:</p>
  <p>Revenue (Current Market Share) = $100 million</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>5. Identify The Distribution Channel That Will Provide The Potential Customers For Your Business In 2022</h2>
  <p>Depending on the characteristics of your target demographic, identify the distribution channel that would cater to
    their needs by providing them with a variety of products and services.</p>
  <p>You have to decide whether you want to sell your products and services directly or whether you want to sell through
    distributors and retailers.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>6. Identify The Consumer Buying Behavior For Each Product or Service</h2>
  <p>Once you identify who your target demographic is, look at the consumer buying behavior of your target audience in
    order to understand their needs and common purchasing factors.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>7. Analyze Competitors in Your Market Research</h2>
  <p>In order to look at all opportunities for improvement, it’s important for you to take a close look at the
    competitors in your market research so that you are able to identify what strategies have worked for them and what
    strategies could possibly work for your business as well.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>8. Develop a Marketing Plan That Is Unique To You</h2>
  <p>Every company or entrepreneur is unique in some way. So, it’s important for you to develop a marketing plan that is
    unique to you and your business so that you are able to showcase your strengths, build on your weaknesses, and
    create opportunities.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>Final words</h2>
  <p>Planning your marketing strategy in 2022 is just the starting point. You have to <b>implement the food and beverage
      marketing plan</b> that you came up with during this planning process by 2022.</p>
  <p>It’s important for you to remember that there is a lot more that goes into creating a successful marketing plan for
    your business than just developing a marketing strategy in 2022. Planning your marketing strategy in 2022 means that
    you have identified what <b>beverage marketing strategy</b> would work best for your business and how the
    opportunity can be improved if necessary.</p>

    title: "How SEO helps to boost restaurant business",
    link: "how-can-seo-help-a-local-restaurant-to-build-their-brand",
    data: `
<p>Businesses are always on the lookout for new strategies they can use to get ahead of the competition. Search engine
  optimization, commonly abbreviated as SEO, is one of those strategies that can be used by small businesses to create a
  name for themselves online. If you’re not sure how SEO for local restaurants could be helpful, here are just a few of
  the ways that SEO for restaurants could help build your brand.</p>
<h2>1. SEO Helps Boost Profits</h2>
<p>Small business owners tend to only pay attention to their bottom line, so when you see them attribute Google search
  engine results to an increase in sales, you can be sure that this is because of SEO. However, SEO doesn’t just help
  your bottom line — it’s also a great way to build the reputation of your small business online.</p>

<p>Other Local Businesses: Whether or not your local restaurant is a startup or well-established, chances are that they
  could benefit greatly from using Google and other search engines too (and you should consider building up their
  profile on GMB as well).</p>

<br />

<h2>2. SEO helps boost traffic to your restaurant</h2>
<p>Search engine optimization can also help drive traffic to your restaurant’s website and encourage consumers to visit
  frequently. When potential customers start searching for your business using phrases such as “Best restaurants near
  me” or “best local restaurants” — they’ll most likely see what they’re looking for on Google locator’s search results
  pages, with a map of the area and ratings and reviews of nearby restaurants.</p>

<br />

<h2>3. SEO helps generate more leads</h2>
<p>When people type keywords into a search engine related to your business, you have the chance to capture their
  information. In addition, simply being visible in the Google results will increase your chances of collecting more
  leads.</p>

<br />

<h2>4. SEO helps provide your restaurant with more exposure to social media</h2>
<p>One of the ways that you can use SEO to boost your online presence is by making sure that you have a presence on as
  many social media platforms as possible. This will help you ensure that any Google searches related to your business,
  either by name or other relevant keywords, will turn up results that include your social media and website listings.
</p>

<p>The extra exposure can generate leads and interest in your restaurant and its menu which can also lead to more
  frequent visits from customers (and potentially new customers). If they like what they see online, they’ll check out
  the reviews and get more information about the businesses through Google and other search engines.</p>

<br />

<h2>5. SEO helps lay the groundwork for long-term success</h2>
<p>The only way SEO can generate traffic to your restaurant is if your website has a high ranking in the search engines.
  This means, that even if you can’t see results right away, you have to be careful about keyword density, content, and
  other factors that help boost your ranking so that you get more traffic over the long term. That’s why it’s best to
  hire a professional who can provide your local business with everything they need to build their online presence.</p>

<br />

<h2>6. SEO helps build your restaurant’s brand</h2>
<p>Ultimately, SEO is all about creating an online presence for your business. If you want potential customers to know
  more about you and check out your website, you need to pay attention to what keywords you’re using on your website.
  But once you have a presence in the search engines, it’s important to make sure that it’s easy for people to find what
  they’re looking for online.</p>

<p>If most of your content is related to the products and services you provide (and include original photos of using
  those products), that will help people find what they’re looking for more quickly so that they can come in and try out
  your food.</p>

<br />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>SEO can help you build your restaurant to be more successful and grow your business, so don’t hesitate to leave us a
  comment if you have any questions.</p>`,

    title: "6 Steps To Do Performance Marketing For Restaurants",
    link: "steps-to-do-performance-marketing-for-restaurants",
    data: `
<div>
  <p>Being a restaurant owner is exciting, challenging, and requires lots of work. Can you see yourself, lunch rush
    accompanying you as usual, with all the food orders coming in? Or are you looking to take on the challenge of
    performance marketing? The chances are high that if you have even thought about launching a new concept or selling
    your restaurant’s services to different venues, performance marketing is one of the ways.</p>
  <p>Searching for a performance marketing company?</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>Here are 6 steps to do performance marketing for restaurants.</h2>
</div>
<br />

<div>
  <h2>1) Learn what works:</h2>
  <p>What do you really need to know when getting started?</p>

  <p>What is the right place to start with performance marketing? Perhaps your competitors are already doing it, and
    they have been able to take advantage of the changing times.</p>

  <p>If this is the case, you can choose not to bother yourself. However, if you wish to make things work for yourself,
    then it would be great if you know what works for your competition in terms of generating traffic and sales.</p>

  <p>You would want to understand the way or the ways that make their model successful. You should also learn where they
    are spending most of their resources; things like search engine marketing (SEM), social media, pay-per-click (PPC)
    advertising campaigns, etc.</p>
</div><br />
<div>
  <h2>2) Diversify:</h2>
  <p>If you are still considering performance marketing as a new, exciting proposition in the face of what is already
    established and working for your competitors.</p>

  <p>But if you have decided to do it anyway, then you should choose a different approach. If your competitors are
    utilizing everything from those mentioned above to their advantage, then there is no point in trying to perform the
    exact same way.</p>

  <p>Instead of that, why not take a more holistic approach? Focus on generating traffic and sales from both organic
    search traffic and paid advertising campaigns while taking into account social media. Then when all these are done,
    focus on conversion rate optimization (CRO) and learn how to brand yourself among your target audience.</p>
</div><br />


<div>
  <h2>) Budget:</h2>
  <p>How much can you really afford to do? In most cases, the answer is always: it depends. What is more important is to
    get a realistic figure in mind first. That will help you decide what kind of budget you can actually afford and
    where you should put it.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>4) Identify your target market:</h2>
  <p>This would be an aspect that needs to be carefully done for every performance marketing campaign. Why just leave
    the possibilities to run wild?</p>

  <p>It would be great being able to know exactly how many people are likely to come from each area when looking at the
    demographic data of your location. If your target audience is potential customers from surrounding areas and
    regions, then it would be best if you ran advertisements in those areas as well.</p>

  <p>If however you just want to focus on the same sets of people that go to your location, then it would be better if
    you consider doing store advertising as well.</p>
</div><br />


<div>
  <h2>5) Define your objectives:</h2>
  <p>Once you have decided how to create and run performance marketing for restaurant campaigns, it’s time to figure out
    what you would want it to achieve.</p>

  <p>There are some common objectives for which companies do performance marketing. These may include anything from
    generating sales and traffic, getting leads, managing foot traffic, and closing sales.</p>

  <p>Different types of campaigns will be needed for each objective. It is best being able to know exactly what kind of
    campaign would work best for your purpose and initial goals.</p>
</div><br />
<div>
  <h2>6) Continuously Creating Content:</h2>
  <p>Nowadays, it has always been advised to create and post fresh and unique content to increase the visibility of
    commercial websites. This method is not only applicable to website owners but can also be used by restaurants for
    promotional purposes.</p>

  <p>You should have a constant flow of new content or articles ready to be posted on your social media platforms such
    as Facebook and Twitter. Be sure to always use full image descriptions too while posting. Your customers will
    appreciate the extra information as they read through your posts, some of them may also make bookings or get
    interested in what you have so much available in store.</p>
</div><br />
<div>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>If you are still thinking about what to do as your first step in terms of performance marketing for restaurants,
    then this article should answer all your questions. After doing a little bit of research on what has been working
    for others, you will be able to establish how you would want to start, where to put your budget, and when or when
    not to go for each type of campaign.</p>

  <p>You might have the right idea but it may take some time and effort before you get the results that match your

<div>
  <p>Unless you have been living under a rock, the name MetaVerse might sound a bit familiar to you. Everyone everywhere
    is talking about it. There have been discussions and debates around this topic. But what really is MetaVerse?</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>What is MetaVerse?</h2>
  <p>Well simply put into words, MetaVerse is basically a three-dimensional network of virtual reality worlds that only
    exists within the walls of reality headsets. It’s incredibly futuristic and something you see in science fiction
    novels and movies. But now as the human species is rapidly evolving and advancing its technology at a much faster
    rate, a “virtual life” is very much becoming the new hot topic considering how possible all of it looks now. Meta,
    formerly known as Facebook, has recently launched its Oculus VR Series which is one of the most advanced virtual
    reality headsets ever created.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>What can You do in MetaVerse?</h2>
  <p>You can do anything that doesn’t necessarily require your physical presence. You can play games with friends and
    hang out in a comedy club afterward in the form of avatars. You can go to places that exist in a particular
    augmented reality (AR) which is just a computerized representation of the real world and just roam around and enjoy
    passing your time. You can also go to know places that do not exist and have a good time like in the case of several
    Virtual Reality where you can grab the rest of your gear and smash fruits with your virtual sword.</p>

  <p>But the real reason why we are here right now is to discuss the effect the MetaVerse will have on the food and
    beverage industry. How will restaurants and cafés work in such an environment? Well, we are here to help you break
    it down and make you understand the A to Z on this concern.</p>

  <p>But before that, we would like to talk about NFTs which is another one of the trending topics right now. To briefly
    understand non-fungible tokens, you will need to understand a form of currency exchange that is not really equal in
    value. 15 coins can be traded for 15 coins because they possess the same value. However, every NFT is unique and
    can’t be equaled by a value.</p>

  <p>Now, moving on to ……</p>
</div>
<br />
<div>
  <h2>The Effect of MetaVerse on the Food and Beverage Industry</h2>
  <p>People are investing millions of dollars into the metaverse to acquire digital property. A lot of digital real
    estate is for sale now in the metaverse and investors are constantly trying to clasp the best deals. In the same
    way, the big names in the food and beverage industry are trying to come up with creative ways to invest in the food
    market of the metaverse. There have been talks of even exchanging real food for NFTs.</p>

  <p>Imagine you are in the metaverse, and you acquire the NFTs to an XYZ restaurant through a game or by any other
    means, you could even end up exchanging that token for a real meal from the XYZ restaurant in the real world. All of
    this sounds exciting and confusing at the same time, doesn’t it?</p>

  <p>We completely understand! MetaVerse is still in this very fetal stage and it will take a while before we start
    going into virtual restaurants with our friends and families as Avatars but a business needs to be prepared for the
    opportunity when it drops by.</p>

  <p>But you shouldn’t be waiting for the expansion of MetaVerse in order to market your food and beverage business and
    should start now. If the marketing side of the business has a habit of overwhelming you, don’t worry about it, and

  <h2>1) Listen To Your Customers: </h2>
  <p>The only way to know what works best for your restaurant is to listen to your customers. Your menu, the way you
    serve dishes, and even the design of your restaurant can all be improved by listening.</p>
  <p>Consider how many restaurants have outside seating during the summer. Not too many. But they do have a great deal
    of business in that section of their restaurant! Now consider how many restaurants have inside seating on a hot
    summer day and barely any business. Not too many. That is the power of hearing what customers want. Don’t try to be
    everything for everyone.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>2) Provide Something Different:</h2>
  <p>Regardless of what you eat, people need something to make them stop and do something different. Sometimes people
    just like to sit around and talk, and if you have seating for that, people will be much more likely to stop in for a
    bite to eat.</p>
  <p>This applies elsewhere in the restaurant as well. If you have an area where people can get outside and play games,
    or just sit and relax, then even more people will be inclined to come in for a bite to eat.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>3) Offer Complimentary Items:</h2>
  <p>The best way to make a customer happy is to give them something for free in appreciation for their business. There
    is nothing wrong with surprising your customers with a complimentary appetizer, dessert, or even drink.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>4) Have A Unique Menu:</h2>
  <p>Your menu should be different and unique. If you are not offering something that people cannot get anywhere else,
    then you may as well not have much of a restaurant at all.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>5) Send Out Loyalty Cards or Discounts: </h2>
  <p>Loyalty programs are incredibly common, which is why they work so well. But the best loyalty program you can have
    is one where you send out cards or discounts to your customers that let them know how much you appreciate their
    business.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>6) Maintain Quality Systems (i.e. HACCP): </h2>
  <p>Having a clean restaurant is important, but having a clean restaurant that is free of contaminants is even more
    important. Food safety is one of the most vital parts of doing business in the hospitality industry and it has been
    proven time and time again that it can be an incredibly successful strategy for restaurants.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <h2>7) Check-In on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter:</h2>
  <p>One of the most effective ways that businesses can stay up to date is by being on social media. Not only will you
    be able to know what is going on with your customers, but you could also build a loyal following in the process.</p>
  <p>Make sure that your brand is represented correctly and in an appealing way, and set a good example for your
    customers. This can create a strong bond between your restaurant and its customers, which will result in better
    business down the road.</p>
</div>

  <p>This is not an exhaustive list of marketing strategies. This list was created to be complementary to the knowledge
    you already have and are familiar with. If you have a different marketing strategy that has helped you, or know that
    other strategies work, please feel free to share them in the comments below!</p>

<p>We personally believe that the first step towards success lies in building a strong brand. The journey may be a bit
  tiresome and time-consuming but do not lose hope – we’re here with you to guide you till the end.</p>
<p>We have been there when it was very tough to stand out against our competitors and slowly, with years of effort and
  hard work, we have made our mark in the market as one of the most admired names out there! ????</p>
<p>We assisted The Asian Wok to set up its cloud kitchen in Kolkata, did their social media, provided them with
  consultation, helped them with menu and signage designing, and viola – they’re doing amazing today! Check out the pdf
  below and let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!</p>
<p>Get in touch with us today for a free consultation and let’s create some magic together! When we first started with
  Fielmente, people often told us, “What’s so special about it? There are already loads of agencies doing exactly the
  same!”</p>
<p>And we cannot find a better day than today to reply to that!</p>
<p>One of the most valuable clients of Fielmente, ‘The Asian Wok” has spread its wings with loads of new customers and
  orders incoming every day!</p>
<p>What did Fielmente do?</p>
<ol>
  <li>We helped them start from scratch and helped them create an effective roadmap.</li>
  <li>We did their branding – designed their logo, made a color pallet, and designed intriguing menu options for them.
  </li>
  <li>Then we hopped on social media – we helped them to build a strong online presence through organic postings and ads
    and created various offers and deals to attract more and more orders.</li>
  <li>Later on, we also designed their signage boards for a bit of offline marketing and it started to work like a
    wonder!</li>
  <li>Our team provided them with 24/7 consultation to assist them whenever they got stuck at any place, at any time.
  </li>
  <li>We helped them set up the whole Cloud Kitchen restaurant in Kolkata and guided them to deliver proper orders with
    proper packaging on time.</li>

</ol>
<p>And there it is – they’re doing more than great today! Fielmente doesn’t just take up orders and complete them – we
  stand by our clients from start to end until they become highly profitable and well-branded!</p>
<p>We want to thank our clients for giving us this opportunity to prove our potential to them and a big kudos to team
  Fielmente for excellent coordination and all the hard work!</p>

  <p>Through exclusive groups and broadcast listing, small enterprises sell their offerings to their specific clients to
    create strong interactions with them. On the other hand, medium-sized and big businesses utilize the new premium
    WhatsApp Business API to enjoy their consumers by providing them with information about their purchases, receiving
    customer feedback, and even frequent updates.<br /> WhatsApp can be a really good way to directly connect with your
    consumers. There is nothing special you can do in this, it is just that you will be reaching each one of consumers,
    directly to them, unlike social media platforms.</p>
  <p>WhatsApp enables brands to establish a business page on the app, which is similar to Facebook. Your profile will
    provide customers with crucial information like location, description, website, and contact information. A catalog
    may
    also be added.<br />
    You may contact consumers directly if you utilize WhatsApp Business. You may also automate messages with a chatbot
    so
    that your viewers can respond fast to their inquiries.</p>

    <li>Tweets with photographs enhance retweets by an average of 35 percent. Please remember to keep the messages under
      the limit for retweets and comments at least 20 characters.</li>

      algorithm can change and you will have the ability to influence your audience’s interaction with Facebook posts
      with less language.</li>
    <li>Remember: You publish your brand, so publish true “insider” pictures at greater engagement rates.</li>

  <p>The concept of a cloud kitchen is booming in India, especially during the ongoing pandemic, when takeaway has
    become
    the most preferred choice of customers. However, managing a cloud kitchen has always been baffling, fortunately,
    there
    are POS solutions.</p>

  <p>It is something every cloud kitchen must invest in for smooth operations of day-to-day activities. POS software not
    only handles the billing, but it also makes it easy for customers to place an order with great convenience, online
    order integration with Zomato or Swiggy, and order & inventory management.</p>

  <br />
  <h2>Management- Improve your hotel business in the new normal</h2>
  <p>The hotel business has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are things that <b>hotel managers can</b>
    do to
    adapt to the new normal and <b>achieve success.</b></p>

  <p>First and foremost <b>devise an emergency management plan.</b> This plan should cover all scenarios related to
    emergencies
    including natural disasters, pandemics, and security threats.</p>

  <p><b>Create a safe and healthy environment for your guests and staff.</b> The cleaning and sanitizing procedures must
    be
    followed strictly. Also, maintain a healthy supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff.</p>

  <p>Establish a <b>connection with travel agents as they are a valuable source of bookings</b> for hotels. Even during
    the
    off-season travel agents can increase your visibility to potential guests and generate more reservations.</p>

  <p><b>Monitor your guest’s travel history to ensure their safety.</b> It will help you to properly sanitize the rooms
    and take
    preventive measures if needed.</p>

    season, so
    come up with strategies for the same. Even during the off-season, there are things you can do to increase hotel
    occupancy and generate revenue. Like,</p>

  <p>– <b>Offer competitive rates and discounts</b> to attract budget-minded travelers.

  <p>– <b>Offer package deals</b> that include accommodation, meals, activities, or other amenities that your hotel can
    provide.

  <p>– <b>Run promotions for large groups</b> of families or business travelers.

  <p>– <b>Host events</b> such as conferences, expos, weddings, holiday parties, flea markets or music festivals.
